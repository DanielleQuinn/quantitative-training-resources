To maintain an equitable learning environment, students should not be disadvantaged if they do not have their own laptops. In a Fall 2019 class of 30 students, 2 students have not been able to bring a laptop. In addition, 2 other students had problems with their computers breaking during the semester and needed to use university resources temporarily. I have been at a graduate student committee meeting where the graduate student was using their own personal laptop and it was not working sufficiently well. These situations suggest requiring laptops for undergraduates is not accessible for everyone and would be unfair. An instructor for a BIOL 2000- lab reported that 5% of students are not able to bring their own laptop a lab which offers this as an option.

For those students that would like to use their own laptops, I believe this can be valuable. If a student has installed software on their own computer they can more easily return to advanced studies using that software, for example, a biology student that uses R in a class can more easily start using it for their honours thesis if they have the software installed on their computer. In addition, one challenge we have every semester is finding paths to upload data we have downloaded into R. This can be very system specific, and I think it helps the students to have confidence that in a new setting (i.e. their honours), they should be able to get the data upload working on their own laptop. We have allowed students to bring their laptops to class and have solved a wide variety of platform- and software-specific software installation issues that are well beyond our expertise, and we do this because we are trying to help the students as much as we can, even though we risk criticism if we are unable to solve these problems.
