## Why Github?
These materials are hosted on Github to promote openness and collaboration to capitalize on a diversity of skills and interest in quantitative training within the department.

## Facts about Github
1. Github hosts repositories: collections of documents organized in folders. Github is designed with the idea that you want to download all the files, however, you can work around this and download individual files. Should you want to maintain an up-to-date version of the entire repository, Github Desktop can be helpful.
2. Github is like having your Dropbox files open to the public, while allowing the public to edit your Dropbox files.
3. What if someone deletes all the files or messes them up? There are two reasons this can't happen:
  - contributors can only recommend changes to the repository, for the changes to be adopted they need to be approved by the owner or a collaborator; and
  - if a 'bad' change is accidently approved, the history of all commits to the repository are logged anyway. To delete a file, you would need to make a commit, and so it is possible to trace back through the commit history and restore a deleted the file.
4. What am I looking at? You're looking at a files organized into folders. Navigate throught the folders to the document you want to read.

## How can I contribute?
1. You need a github account. This is to keep track of who is recommending changes.
2. If you just have comments, then submit these as an `issue`.
3. If you want to make edits, then you have two options:
  * a. Edit directly on the github website
  * b. Download the file and edit it locally using your own software.
  
### a. Editing directly on the github website
1. Some files, notably .csv, .md, and .txt formats, can be edited directly on github.
2. Navigate to the file you want to edit and click on the `pencil` icon on the righthand side of the page.
3. You should be prompted to fork the repository. This means you are starting your own `branch`. You have been required to do this because you don't have permission to edit the `master` (main) version of this repository. This ensures that the owner and collaborators stay in control of the repositories contents.
4. You will now see raw text that you can edit as you please. You can save your work by submitting a `commit` (big green button). If you make a `commit`, you haven't changed the `master` version of the repository, just your personal copy: your `branch`.
5. When are ready for your changes to be reviewed by a collaborator (or the owner), then you need to submit a `pull` request. This should be another big green button. If you don't have the option to submit a `pull` request, the problem may be that you haven't committed your most recent changes.
6. If a long time passes between when you `fork` the repository and when you submit the `pull` request, there may be conflicts and this may make it more difficult to merge your changes into the `master` branch.

### b. Download and edit using your own softward
