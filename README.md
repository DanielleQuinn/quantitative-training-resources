## Why Github?
These materials are hosted on Github to promote openness and collaboration to capitalize on a diversity of skills and interest in quantitative training within the department.

## Facts about Github
1. Github hosts repositories: collections of documents organized in folders.
2. What am I looking at? You're looking at a files organized into folders. Navigate throught the folders to the document you want to read. Some files my have confusing extensions like .md or .gitignore. The .md files are text files: you can open them in a text editor, but they are easy to read and edit on the github website. The .gitignore file can be ignored.
3. Github is like having your Dropbox files open to the public, while allowing the public to edit your Dropbox files. This is the power of Github in facilitating collaboration.
4. What if someone deletes all the files or messes them up? There are two reasons this can't happen:
  - contributors can only recommend changes to the repository, for the changes to be adopted they need to be approved by the owner or a collaborator; and
  - if a 'bad' change is accidently approved, the history of all commits to the repository are logged anyway. To delete a file, you would need to make a commit, and so it is possible to trace back through the commit history and restore a deleted the file.
5. If the power of Github is in facilitating open collaboration, everything 'complicated' about Github arises from the need to keep track of, and control, who makes what changes to which version of the repository. 
6. Github is designed with the idea that you want to download all the files, however, you can work around this and download individual files. Should you want to maintain an up-to-date version of the entire repository, Github Desktop can be helpful.


## How can I contribute?
1. If do not wish to use github yourself, then you can email me ahurford@mun.ca and please indicated if you give permission for your contributions to be added to the repository. If you're ready to give github a try then go to 2.
2. You need a github account. This is to keep track of who is recommending changes.
3. If you just have comments, then submit these as an `issue`.
4. If you want to make edits, then you have two options:
  * a. Edit directly on the github website
  * b. Download the file and edit it locally using your own software.
5. You can also add a file to the repository.
  
### 3a. Editing directly on the github website
1. Some files, notably .csv, .md, and .txt formats, can be edited directly on github.
2. Navigate to the file you want to edit and click on the `pencil` icon on the righthand side of the page.
3. You should be prompted to fork the repository. This means you are starting your own `branch`. You have been required to do this because you don't have permission to edit the `master` (main) version of this repository. This ensures that the owner and collaborators stay in control of the repositories contents.
4. You will now see raw text that you can edit as you please. You can save your work by submitting a `commit` (big green button at the bottom of the page. You may need to scroll down). If you make a `commit`, you haven't changed the `master` version of the repository, just your personal copy: your `branch`.
5. When are ready for your changes to be reviewed by a collaborator (or the owner), then you need to submit a `pull` request. This should be another big green button at the bottom of the page (you may need to scroll down). If you don't have the option to submit a `pull` request, the problem may be that you haven't committed your most recent changes. Alternatively, you may need to provide a title and description for you `pull` request.
6. If a long time passes between when you `fork` the repository and when you submit the `pull` request, there may be conflicts and this may make it more difficult to merge your changes into the `master` branch.

### 3b. Download and edit files using your own software
1. Navigate through the folder system to the file you want to suggest edits on.
2. If the file is a .pdf or a .docx you should see a button to download the file. If the file is .md, .txt, or .csv then you won't see the download button. Instead on the righthand side of the page you should able to select the `Raw` tab. Copy and paste all the text from the `Raw` file into a text editor (Microsoft Word, TextEdit, etc).
3. Make your edits to the file on your computer. If the file is an .md, .txt, or .csv you need to keep to keep it simple (i.e., don't add figures).
4. When you are finished your edits, try to save the file in it's original format: same name and same extension (if you are not able this is not a big deal).
5. Open a web browser and go to the Github repository online. Navigate through the file system to find the folder you wish to submit your file to (i.e. the location of the original file you downloaded).
6. You should see the option to `Upload file`. If you do not, you may need to log in to Github. You may try navigating to a higher level of the folder structure. Alternatively, if the file is .md or .txt you might click the `pencil` icon, then delete the existing text and copy and paste in your revised text.
7. You may be prompted to log in to Github, and you may be prompted to fork the repository, i.e. create your own `branch`. A  `branch` is your personal copy of the repository. You have been asked to create a `branch` because you do not have permission to change the `master` (the main) branch of the repository.
8. To save the changes to your `branch` you need to `commit` them (big green button). If unavailable you may need to provide a title and description of the changes.
9. To have your changes reviewed for potential inclusion on the `master` branch you need to submit a `pull` request. This should be a big green button at the bottom of the screen. If unavailable you may need to `commit` your changes first, or provide a title and description of your changes.

## 4. Add a file to the repository
1. On the Github website for the repository you want to add to, navigate to through the folders to find the location where you want to add the file.
2. Near the top of the page you should see a the option to `Upload a file`. 
3. Follow steps 7.-9. in the above section 3a.
