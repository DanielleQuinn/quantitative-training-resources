These are my _prelimary_ ideas as of Oct 30, 2019, but I have not consulted widely enough to be confidence in these recommendations at this point. As such, I welcome feedback.

The revision of the biology curiculuum with respect to quantitative training should have two objectives:
1. Prepare biology majors for quantitative skills that are expected in 3000 and 4000 courses in their choosen stream; and
2. Upon completing our BSc program (or potentially only specific streams of our program), if a student were given data and some context, the student can apply their biological knowledge to form a hypothesis, and make some progress on assessing whether the data support their hypothesis using statistics and/or data visualization.

Objective 1. will be addressed by surveying the faculty to identify what skills are considered necessary. Potentially, 1. may be entirely subsumed under 2.

## Stats
Deconvolving 2., currently, the statistical knowledge from BIOL 4605 is excellent, but goes beyond what is needed to minimally fulfil 2. By integrating some aspects of BIOL 4605 into our existing courses, and consulting with math to make sure STAT 2550 is 'working for us', we can, in my view, achieve a reasonable level of statistical understanding. Having had some very good conversations with DS, here are some simple steps that would yield substantial progress:

1. Currently, first year students are taught to write a hypothesis and a prediction. We need to add: draw a graph of the results if your hypothesis was supported; draw a graph if your hypothesis is not supported; and write the equations that correspond to each of your graphs. To teach this we need to say, 'if you think _y_ increases with _x_, but you're not quite sure exactly how, the default assumption, given that _x_ is a continous variable, is that there is a linear relationship, _y=mx+c_. In writing the equations, students get to choose their notation. This is powerful, because biology involves a lot of non-conventional notation, for example, dN/dt = r N (exponential growth), if dN/dt is plotted on the y-axis, and N is plotted on the x-axis, is a straight line with a zero y-intercept and a slope of r, but the notation is a barrier because it isn't in the form _y = mx_.

1. Discuss Type I and Type II errors (Type I: alarm, no fire; Type II: fire, no alarm). The statement from American Statistical Association advocating the downfall of alpha = 0.05, if I understand DS correctly, should now be replaced with a discussion of the types of questions where lower or higher acceptable Type II errors are appropriate, for example, a fire with no alarm is a life and death matter; if my oven timer doesn't go off, then dinner will get burnt which is much less serious and as such a higher Type II error is acceptible for the latter. (I need to read and consult further on this point).

1. Better familiarity with the shapes of functions and non-conventional notational. All graphs should be accompanied by their formulas and in non-conventional notation, if appropriate.

1. To build confidence with writing equations, we might also talk about units (really the only way an equation can go wrong) and give guidelines for notation choices (see links.md for recent paper on this).

1. We need to be consistently reporting the spread of data and discussing overlap with respect to Type II error. At the first year level, we need to be consistently reporting the range of observations around class means (i.e. the minimum and maximum, as well as the mean). Campbell's Canadian Biology has bar graphs with no error bars and asks the students to speculate on if the bar heights are different. This is unacceptable: that question cannot be answered without information on the spread of the data, and it undermines the central role of statistics in biology, to suggest that it can. 

1. Specific use of R for statistical tests, can be taught in STAT 2550, but also could begin in first year labs, as a separate lab dedicated to analyzing data that has been collected in previous labs. We need to incorporate R for statistics into 3000+ courses also where we can.

## Data visualization, archiving, programing
The second aspect of goal 2. is data visualization, which requries skills in programming, and data manipulation. I suspect we may need a dedicated 2000- course for this (and possibly it is appropritate to bring Lourdes' bioinformatics course down to 2000-). We need to reduce our required course load, and, ideally, to the extent that double majors with geogaraphy, math, stats, and computer science could be possible. Data visualization might also include mapping, and should cover the PLOS Computational Biology paper that talks about why bar graphs with 95% CIs can obscure key information (in the links.md file). Better alternatives are beeswarm plots and violin plots and anyone can make these now with R. This course might also touch on clipart, copyright, conceptual diagrams.

## General comments
A key aspect of making progress is continuity across courses within the major including STAT 2550 (Vision and Change can be cited regarding the importance of this point). What we are teaching about 'how to make a graph in R' in first or second year needs to flow up to third and fourth year. To this extent, we need to maintain public (github) and private (brightspace) repositories of our teaching materials. I will hire a TA whose job will be to assemble documentation on how to do particular R tasks, which will be maintained as a bookdown file. As such, it will be available in pdf and ebook. I will consult with Lourdes for this, but ideally this task is a matter of finding links to existing good explanations, for example, the relevant sections of the Pirates Guide to R.

I am leaning towards not getting too far into this in the first year, since the 1001 and 1002 follows closely off of Campbell's Canadian Biology. This book does have some great exercises about reading graphs, but a treatment of statistics is lacking. In addition, 1001 and 1002 are serving non-biology majors. If we were to adopt measures in 1001 and 1002 labs, we should introduce the expectations that all graphs are made in R (or at least on a computer) and that data tables are achived electronically to a github repository. We need to find a reference for best practices in data archiving and build our expectations from here (perhaps this? https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01276). If we expect graphs in R, we may need to add a 'how to make graphs in R' lab, or at least a component of a lab. Data from 1001 and 1002 could also be analyzed in R and this could be a separate lab towards the end of the semester, perhaps just covering 'how to do a linear regression in R'. I suspect that we have sufficient computing resources to achieve all this, but that needs to be flushed out.

I've been trying to figure out 'what are quantitative skills'. Vision and Change wasn't especially helpful, but Competency E1 on p22 of Scientific Foundations for Future Physicians (https://store.aamc.org/scientific-foundations-for-future-physicians-pdf.html) has some good comments.
