1. Reading graphs
1. knowing the equation for a straight line in non-conventional notation
1. Being able to sketch graphs
1. Respecting notation, i.e. don't define f(N1) = N1 and f(N2) = N2^2. If f(N1) = N1, then f(N2) = N2, and to avoid this a new function must be defined: g(x) = x^2, such that g(N2) = N2^2.
1. Words -> Graph -> Equation (Lab 2)
